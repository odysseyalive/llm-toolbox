# The LLM Toolbox

The `convert-hf-to-gguf.ipynb` script is designed to convert Hugging Face models to the GGUF format. This conversion allows for optimized model performance and compatibility with specific deployment environments.

### GGUF Conversion

The `convert-hf-to-gguf.ipynb` script is designed to convert Hugging Face models to the GGUF format. This conversion allows for optimized model performance and compatibility with specific deployment environments.

### Instructions

I'd suggest that this notebook run using the A100 GPU on Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. **Open Google Colab**: Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. **Upload the Notebook**: Click on `File` > `Upload notebook` and select the `convert-hf-to-gguf.ipynb` file.
3. **Enable GPU**: Navigate to `Runtime` > `Change runtime type`, then select `GPU` and choose `A100` from the hardware accelerator options.
4. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the cells in the notebook to perform the conversion using the A100 GPU for accelerated performance.
